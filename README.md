# simple_ts

\[WIP\] The simple way to resolve/infer TypeScript types. Useful to type-aware linting in Rust.

### Goals

- Type inference implemented *within 10k LOC*
- Support [oxc's Type Aware Linting](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/issues/3105)
- Fast enough

### Non-goals

- Type checking
- Type hinting
- 100% TypeScript compatibility
